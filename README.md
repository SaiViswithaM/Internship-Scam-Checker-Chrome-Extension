## Internship Scam Checker (Chrome Extension)

Internship Scam Checker is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to help students and job seekers identify potentially risky internship and job application links.

### ✅ Solution
This extension analyzes the currently opened tab URL and classifies it into:
- **Safe**
- **Caution**
- **Highly Risky**

based on common scam patterns such as URL shorteners, payment keywords, and suspicious hosting platforms.

### 🔧 Features
- Detects risky keywords in URLs
- Works on the currently active tab
- Simple and clean popup UI
- No data collection (privacy-friendly)

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Chrome Extension (Manifest v3)

### 🔒 Privacy
This extension runs entirely on the user's browser and does not store or send any data externally.

### 📌 Note
This tool provides basic risk indication and should be used as a precautionary aid, not as a final decision-maker.
