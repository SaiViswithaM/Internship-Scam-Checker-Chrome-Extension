based on common scam patterns such as URL shorteners, payment keywords, and suspicious hosting platforms.

### 🔧 Features
- Detects risky keywords in URLs
- Works on the currently active tab
- Simple and clean popup UI

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS

### 🔒 Privacy
This extension runs entirely on the user's browser and does not store or send any data externally.

### 📌 Note
This tool provides basic risk indication and should be used as a precautionary aid, not as a final decision-maker.
